This example demonstrates usage of a new library called [d3-component](https://github.com/curran/d3-component) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) to create a scatter plot with menus for X, Y, Z and color, and some animations. It's an experiment to see how things play out when pairing D3 directly with Redux, without React in the middle.
